# SoJS

Making cool stuff since 2017

I primarly code on replit.com to prototype, so I am most active there. I have started using github a lot more (as of 2023 if this readme ages), so you'll see stuff pop up here as well, but you might as well go [check me out there](https://replit.com/@sojs)

See all of my work [on my personal site](https://45.33.54.245:3000/)

Feel free to contact me at any time on discord (sojs#8307) for any work you want done, things you want to see me do, issues working any of my projects, or literally anything else.

Also, if anyone cares or asked, I code in node.js and ChatGPT prompt language üëç
